# Notebooks
This repository is a collection of useful [Python notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) I've created either for personal or professional usage.  At the time of this writing, all notebooks run in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/), so some features and dependencies may only work there.

## Notebooks' Structure

```markdown
# Notebook Name
Description

... (code, markdown, etc.)
```

## Adding Notebooks
1. Copy the `.ipynb` files to `notebooks/library`
2. Run the `cataloguer.sh` script to normalize the file names
3. Run the `redactor.sh` script to remove outputs and avoid data leakage
