# Notebooks
This repository is a collection of useful [Python notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) I've created either for personal or professional usage.  At the time of this writing, all notebooks run in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/), so some features and dependencies may only work there.

## Sanitization
Before commiting, it's highly recommeded that you run the `redactor.sh` script to remove the outputs from all notebooks.
